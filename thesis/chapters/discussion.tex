\section{Evaluation Criteria}
\textcolor{red}{
How will we evaluate? What?}

The two main questions this thesis answers are both subjective to a certain extend. The potential of D3 in data visualization will be determined and evaluated by looking at the many use-case examples which can be found online, as well as the resulting show-case of this thesis. Besides having a look at how D3 can be used, we will also look at where it is possible to use D3. As there are many scenarios in which the JavaScript environment is not required, desired or possible. This leads us into the second question of the advantages and disadvantages of D3. To evaluate this question, we will evaluate the initial learning curve, the effort to create static and dynamic diagrams, the amount and functionalities of available modules, the completeness of documentation as well as pros and cons which come with the web environment.
