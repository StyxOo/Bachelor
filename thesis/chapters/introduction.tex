Something about the importance of infographics and comprehendible data. 


The postmodern world produces huge amounts of data every second. Analyzing this data leads to better-informed decision-making in every sector. Yet the wast amounts of created data is often hard to comprehend with the human mind. Data visualization is about finding ways to represent this data in visually appealing, yet easily understandable visual representations. Doing this quickly and always up to date can be crucial. There are many tools available to help with the creation of infographics. Some of these tools have a graphical-user-interface, are programming based. This thesis will be a deep dive into the possibilities of one of these tools, the 'd3.js'(D3) library for JavaScript. To show its capabilities and potential D3 will be used to create a showcase containing several different graphics.
