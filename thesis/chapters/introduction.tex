Something about the importance of infographics and comprehendible data. 


The postmodern world produces huge amounts of data every second. Analyzing this data leads to better-informed decision-making in every sector. Yet the wast amounts of created data is often hard to comprehend with the human mind. Data visualization is about finding ways to represent this data in visually appealing and easily understandable visual representations. Doing this quickly and always up to date can be crucial. There are many tools available to help with the creation of infographics. This thesis focusses on computer based solutions. Some of the data visualization tools have a graphical-user-interface, others are code based. It is often not easy to decide which tool best suits ones needs. Therefore this thesis will be a deep dive into the possibilities of one of these tools, the 'd3.js'(D3) library for JavaScript. This will help evaluate if D3 is the right tool for the job, as well as provide a starting-point for using the technology. To achieve this there are two main questions that will be answered in this thesis. What is the potential of D3 in data visualization? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using D3? To be able to evaluate these questions a showcase of a several different diagrams is created.
