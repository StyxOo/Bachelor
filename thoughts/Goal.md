# Goal
## What?
The goal is to create a showcase for the possibilities of [[d3.js]]. 

## How?
We will several vastly different kinds of [[diagrams]] to display the range of possibilities of [[d3.js]].

### Ok, but seriously, how?
- [ ] First we will have a look at types of [[diagrams]].
- [ ] Then select a range of [[diagrams]] with different use-cases (i.e. **not** a line and a bar diagram).
- [ ] For the selection of [[diagrams]] we decide how they can be applied in the [[Context]] of the Ukrain conflict
- [ ] We need to find the required data to create the [[diagrams]]
- [ ] The [[diagrams]] will be implemented individually
- [ ] And if possible, the [[diagrams]] will all come together in a nice visually pleasing showcase

### Side-Objectives
- How accessible is [[d3.js]]?
- Where are the limitations of [[d3.js]]?
