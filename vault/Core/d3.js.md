# D3.js
D3.js is a JavaScript library. Learn more [here](https://d3js.org/).

## Notes
- Make sure to have d3 script tag in html AFTER tags you are trying to access !!
- To avoid `# Reason: CORS request not HTTP` error, host directory using python3.9.7. Command is : `python3 -m http.server` or long: `python3 -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /path/to/dir`
- When changing the css files, make sure to do a full reload, aka <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>
- To change order of elements, change order of execution in script. Last executed is drawn last, aka on top
- In case a svg is precreated and then appended to the DOM, check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25516078/d3-create-object-without-appending) if d3 gives a `unexpected string` error (or something like this)
