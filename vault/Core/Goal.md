# Goal
## What?
The goal is to create a showcase for the possibilities of [[d3.js]]. 

## How?
We will several vastly different kinds of [[Diagrams]] to display the range of possibilities of [[d3.js]].

### Ok, but seriously, how?
- [x] First we will have a look at types of [[Diagrams]].

> Have a look at [[Diagrams]]

- [x] Then select a range of [[Diagrams]] with different use-cases (i.e. **not** a line and a bar diagram).

> Have a look at the [[diagrams-showcase-mockup.pdf]] for the selection

- [x] For the selection of [[Diagrams]] we decide how they can be applied in the [[Context]] of the Ukrain conflict

> We show refugee data

- [x] We need to find the required [[Data]] to create the [[Diagrams]]

> Look at the data in the project/data folder
> We take the refugee data from UNHCR

- [ ] The [[Diagrams]] will be implemented individually

- [ ] And if possible, the [[Diagrams]] will all come together in a nice visually pleasing showcase

### Side-Objectives
- How accessible is [[d3.js]]?
- Where are the limitations of [[d3.js]]?
