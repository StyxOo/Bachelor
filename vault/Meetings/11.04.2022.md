# Progress Meeting

## Prepared Questions:
#### About the expos√©:
- Title: 
	- [ ] Not sure how much the actual conflict will come up, as it's hard to find data. It is much easier to find more general/pre-war data. Maybe adjust the title? Or
	- [ ] Find more data on the conflict? Email to Verteidigungsministerium?
- Basics: 
	- [ ] Infographics - Is it necessary? Is it enough? Should there be more information for the full thesis or is it assumed to be known?
	- Technologies:
		- [ ] HTML, JavaScript and CSS are ok to be assumed known?
		- [ ] Should Python be mentioned, as it is not relevant for the result?
		- [ ] Should I mention and/or explain git? It seems very important, yet THB doesn't seem to think so..
		- [ ] What about software that was used. Like Obsidian or VS-Code. Probably too much?
		- [ ] Is this the right spot to mention which D3 version was used and in which browsers it was tested?
		- [ ] As D3 is in the spotlight, it is probably valid to go more in depth about how it works and is structured. So this should get its own section, right?
- Diagrams: 
	- [ ] As it can be quite a lot, should it be explained more in depth? I.e. a visual overview of use-cases and diagrams?
- Data: 
	- [ ] Is it ok to make claims like beeing "generally percieved as reliable"?
#### Other questions:
- [ ] Did the other professor answer?
- [ ] When will the next meeting be?
- [ ] Should I try to aim for a wide rage of diagrams or rather less but more polished?
- [ ] Would you like access to the git repository?
	- [ ] If it is set to public: which parts should be redacted?
- [ ] Anythink in my style of work which I could improve for personal groth?
